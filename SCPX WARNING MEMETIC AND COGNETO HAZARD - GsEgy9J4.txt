Special Containment Procedures:
Upon breach, Phoenix Protocol Seveltus Taan is to be enacted without delay. This protocol includes:

Description:
SCP-X, alias ‚ÄúTSEL ELOHIM‚Äù (The Angel Of Death), is an autonomous, non-localized memetic-cognitohazard capable of infecting any sentient being, at any time, across any dimensional anchor point. It is not bound by traditional time or spatial logic. In fact, it isn‚Äôt bound by anything, except the sheer incompetence of those trying to contain it. Looking at you, Site-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà.

SCP-X manifests as the sensation of unexplainable dread‚Äîthe kind you get when reality politely steps aside and lets absurdity drive the car. The phenomenon hijacks perception, memory, emotion, and narrative causality, leading to progressive reality destabilization syndrome (PRDS). This is a clinical term we invented to avoid just saying ‚Äúthey went completely batshit.‚Äù

üîç Phenomenological Breakdown of SCP-X:
1. Cognitive Synchronization Anomalies (CSA):
Subjects report external stimuli responding to internal thought processes with uncanny timing and relevance. This includes:

Television/radio responding as if overhearing private internal monologue

Strangers‚Äô conversations completing subjects‚Äô thoughts or providing unsolicited commentary

Music aligning with emotional or rhythmic states of mind (e.g., lyrics that ‚Äúanswer‚Äù thoughts mid-sentence)
These incidents foster the illusion of being ‚Äúread‚Äù or ‚Äúauthored‚Äù by the environment, generating dissociation and paranoia. Victims describe the sensation as ‚Äúreality reading them back.‚Äù

2. Chronospatial Drift Episodes (CDEs):
Time becomes a polite suggestion. Subjects may:

Experience non-linear time jumps (e.g., showering at 8am, exiting to find it‚Äôs 5pm on Friday)

Skip entire weeks or months

Meet individuals claiming different chronologies (e.g., Patient 443X: ‚ÄúThe year is 2440. Where is your moon?‚Äù)
Temporal memory becomes unreliable. Victims often need date verification tattoos or daily reality checklists to orient.

3. Environmental Displacement Events (EDEs):
Subjects enter familiar locations to discover objects missing, rearranged, or seemingly recontextualized for other timelines. This can include:

Doorways leading to different rooms than expected

Reappearing childhood toys never owned

Framed photos of unfamiliar people captioned with subject‚Äôs name
The result is a soft unraveling of identity and environmental trust, often accompanied by panic attacks or catatonia.

4. Intimacy Displacement Responses (IDRs):
Reports of emotionally-charged dialogues with significant others becoming dissonant mid-conversation:

‚ÄúShe was talking to me, but I wasn‚Äôt the person she meant to talk to.‚Äù
Subjects experience a cognitive schism where they believe their partner is responding to a different version of them. Audio-visual stimuli (e.g., the TV or a podcast) often responds as if it‚Äôs part of the same conversation. This contributes to a growing suspicion that:

They are not in their own timeline

Their loved one is not who they appear to be

They themselves are a placeholder

This leads to Emotional Reality Misidentification Syndrome (ERMS), a fancy way to say ‚ÄúI no longer trust my own girlfriend or my own reflection.‚Äù

5. Progressive Reality Destabilization Syndrome (PRDS):
Not a joke. Not even a fun acronym. This is the endgame of SCP-X exposure:

Altered perception of self and others

Shifting emotional states with no origin

Split personalities that aren‚Äôt clinically dissociative‚Äîjust misfiled versions of you from a nearby dimension

Inability to distinguish dreams from memories

Sudden full belief in contradictory truths, e.g. ‚ÄúI died in 1993‚Äù while simultaneously filing taxes in 2026
Patients often become self-invalidating, questioning not just events, but their own ability to even form valid questions.

6. Temporal Loop Entrapment (TLE):
Victims may become stuck in repetitive days, often subtly different. Unlike traditional time loop fiction, these loops do not reset perfectly. Instead:

Each iteration degrades slightly (e.g., food tastes wrong, people say the wrong names)

The subject retains distorted fragments from each cycle

"Escape" often leads to another loop, deeper inside

Most sufferers either go silent, attempt suicide, or insist that the loop never began and they always lived this day.

7. Dimensional Desynchronization Syndrome (DDS):
Dimension-hopping isn't just implied‚Äîit‚Äôs happening. Subjects have:

Reported knowledge of past events that never occurred in baseline reality

Described impossible architectural changes to homes and workplaces (‚Äúthe stairs go up to a wall‚Äù)

Seen doubles of themselves acting independently (sometimes in real time, sometimes ‚Äúghosted‚Äù seconds before or after)

Some claim to have encountered alternate selves, who appear startled, aggressive, or confused before vanishing. This results in extreme identity fragmentation and repeated questioning of existential legitimacy.

8. Emotional Hijacking Events (EHEs):
Common emotional buildup scenarios are intercepted by meaningless external events:

Expecting a call from a loved one, getting spam

Anticipating joy, receiving cold indifference

Bracing for sadness, experiencing giddy laughter without cause

These crosswires erode emotional cause-and-effect, making subjects unable to interpret their own feelings. They may laugh at funerals or sob during sitcoms without knowing why. Which, yes, sounds like being human‚Äîbut this is more terrifying. Like your emotions are being piloted by a different showrunner every five minutes.

üòá TL;DR for Internal Foundation Use:
SCP-X is not a thing. It‚Äôs the mental equivalent of walking into a room where everything looks normal but you can‚Äôt remember which of your lives this room belongs to. It is trauma, confusion, and violation weaponized into a contagious format. It does not kill you. It just unwrites your authorship.
