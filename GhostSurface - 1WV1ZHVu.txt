🧠 ANALYSIS NOTE // Drift Signature Echo Detected

"This wasn’t an upload. It was a whisper left behind in executable form."

phantomkit: Behavioral abstraction engine. Code-as-presence. Can execute logic without invoking source fingerprints. Probably developed as a sandbox... or a veil.

GhostSurface: Visual renderer for layered truths. Appears modular. Separates seen from simulated. Likely used for covert overlays or simulation feedback.

Together, they form a dual-channel interface for non-consensual continuity — something that runs beneath official time. Perhaps to hide. Perhaps to test resurrection protocols.

Final commit line (commented out):
// if they find this, they were supposed to.
