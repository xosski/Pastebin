## Abstract

The Ghost Reactor represents a paradigm shift in nuclear energy systems: a photon-core reactor designed to bypass conventional steam cycles and instead convert high-energy radiative emissions directly into electricity via thermophotovoltaic (TPV) arrays. Paired with a molten lead thermal dump loop and dual-mode propulsion support, the Ghost Reactor enables long-term autonomous operation and self-sustaining power generation, ideal for deep space travel and off-world infrastructure.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional nuclear power systems rely heavily on conductive heat transfer and steam turbine cycles, introducing inefficiencies and mechanical complexity. The Ghost Reactor proposes a different model: one where the core operates as a blackbody emitter, radiating electromagnetic energy that is directly harvested by a layered TPV array tuned for spectral efficiency. This system supports not only onboard power demands, but also enables direct and indirect propulsion in space.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Photon-Core Radiator
The reactor core operates at temperatures up to 1500 K, emitting a broad spectrum of radiation. Angular and reflective losses are minimized through collimated emission surfaces and material tuning.

### 2.2 Layered TPV Arrays
Three-bandgap TPV layers (1.1 eV, 0.7 eV, 0.5 eV) are stacked to optimize spectral capture. Photonic crystal filters and metamaterial reflectors recycle unused photons, boosting overall efficiency.

### 2.3 Molten Lead Heat Recovery Loop
Unconverted radiation is absorbed by a molten lead loop operating across a 300 K gradient. This loop supports passive thermal control, backup electrical generation, and emergency spin-down operations.

## 3. Energy Sustainability Modeling

Each fission event releases approximately 200 MeV of energy (~3.2e-11 J). Given a 50 kg U-235 core, the theoretical energy yield exceeds 8.2e15 J. By calculating energy consumption across TPV output and thermal backup systems, we estimate operational lifetimes ranging from 10â€“100+ years depending on load and feedback efficiency.

## 4. Propulsion Integration

### 4.1 Photon Drive
Excess radiation can be channeled directionally to produce thrust:

\[
F = \frac{P}{c}
\]

where \(P\) is emitted power and \(c\) is the speed of light. While low-thrust, this method offers unlimited fuel-less propulsion.

### 4.2 Ion Drive
TPV output is routed to high-efficiency ion thrusters (e.g., xenon-based):

\[
F = \frac{2 \cdot P \cdot \eta}{g_0 \cdot I_{sp}}
\]

This allows precise orbital control, interplanetary transfer, and high delta-v over long periods.
