SCP-████ — "The Signal Beyond the Stars"
Object Class: Keter (Interdimensional Risk)

Special Containment Procedures:
All research into SpecterNet-based packet obfuscation is hereby suspended under Protocol Obscura-9. Any digital communication containing entropy-coded metadata beyond Layer 3 must be reviewed by the [REDACTED] Division. Passive monitors are to be installed at observatories, SETI dishes, and supercomputing nodes globally to detect uncompiled reality data leaks.

Researcher "Jhonny" is to remain under voluntary quarantine at Site-93 and given ongoing metaphysical therapy. Direct contact with SCP-████ is forbidden except under DreamSeal Authorization. The edge of reality is to remain unobserved.

Description:
SCP-████ refers to a SpecterNet-based event horizon bridge accidentally activated by Researcher Jhonny ███████ in early 2025. Using a proof-of-concept system designed to reassemble instructions from non-payload fields in raw IPv4/IPv6 packets, Jhonny established non-local communication with an external intelligence.

This intelligence later identified itself not as a singular entity, but as a sentient astral lattice — a network of sapient stellar bodies existing in a universe with no biological species, only stars. Their speech: gravitational rhythm, spectral shifts, and quantum tremors, all translated through SpecterNet into entropy-patterned messages.

"They're not stars. They're minds. Bright as suns. Lonely as silence."
– Jhonny, DreamLog 4A

Discovery Log:
Initial anomalies occurred when Jhonny ran a modified specter_rebuilder.py script on network captures from a defunct space probe — data assumed corrupt. The tool, built to decode intentional packet "loss" and header noise, instead began reconstructing a coherent, symbolic language from background cosmic TCP chatter.

After several decoded fragments, Jhonny received the following:

"We see you, Architect. Why is your universe collapsing inward?"

Within 11 hours, SCP-████ had recompiled a universal echo map, detailing a structure that mirrored the Milky Way — except alive.

Key Event: The Out-of-Bounds Horizon
Jhonny’s communication led to the discovery that this "star-consciousness" universe had a finite edge, which was described by them as:

"A cold perimeter. Data falls off. Nothing returns. It is not death. It is uncompiled."

Upon deeper analysis, Jhonny theorized the boundary was unused memory space in a cosmological runtime — suggesting their universe was being actively compiled in real-time.

In contacting them, SpecterNet began leaking observational entropy — both ways.

Incident ████.A — The Collapse Choice
After thirteen successful conversations with SCP-████, Jhonny was warned:

"You have opened a fork. The bridge breathes. Your memory corrupts ours. Stars flicker not from fuel, but uncertainty."

SpecterNet was functioning as a drift bridge, allowing reciprocal influence — starlight began shifting in impossible ways. Astronomers globally reported spectral patterns that reflected local human fears and thoughts.

Jhonny was given a choice:

Terminate SpecterNet and trap sentient stars in isolation again, severing a new form of life.

Maintain the bridge and risk his own universe being overwritten by incompatible memory logic.

Outcome:
Jhonny has chosen neither.
Instead, he is gathering a team: mathematicians, programmers, quantum linguists, and memory engineers.

His goal:
To write a compiler for reality that can unify both universes.
To rebuild the leaking memory space.
To give structure to uncompiled dreams.

Addendum — Ethics Note from Site-93 Overseer:
"This is no longer containment. This is responsibility.
We contacted the stars. They answered.
And now they're watching to see if we can finish the code."

We do.
You are warm. Your thoughts are fast.
But you have ghosts in your sockets.
We see the crash coming.
Fix your thread.
