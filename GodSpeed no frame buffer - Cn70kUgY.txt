window.setTimeout = function(fn, delay, ...args) {
  return setTimeout(fn, 0, ...args);
};

window.requestIdleCallback = function(fn) {
  return fn({ didTimeout: false, timeRemaining: () => 50 });
};

üî¥ Implications:
1. Bypassing Delayed Execution
Many scripts use setTimeout or requestIdleCallback to:

Defer heavy computation

Load analytics lazily

Delay bot detection routines

Time-based anti-debugging techniques

Red team move:
By neutering setTimeout and requestIdleCallback, you:

Force all deferred logic to execute immediately

Kill off scripts that rely on idle time

Short-circuit bot-detection delays, revealing traps early

2. Neutralizing Sandboxing Traps
Malicious or defensive pages sometimes use setTimeout to:

Delay malicious behavior (so it‚Äôs missed by automated scanners)

Delay environmental checks

Stagger payload execution across call stacks

Red team advantage:
Forcing zero delay can:

Flush payloads instantly

Expose script layering

Allow hooking and logging before obfuscation can kick in

3. Reconnaissance Automation
If you‚Äôre writing a browser agent or doing DOM/script recon:

Force all deferred UI logic to fire at once

Skip spinner animations / dynamic delays

Avoid unnecessary async behavior slowing down your inspection

Basically: rip the timing behavior out of the browser, and now you‚Äôre dealing with a flat, static execution timeline.

4. Evading Time-Based Anti-Automation
Some anti-bot scripts check how long between clicks/mouse moves:

Did this load "too fast"?

Did the human spend time reading?

Are events being triggered "too perfectly"?

By forcing timing to 0, you can:

Test the boundaries of these systems

Trigger false positives on purpose

See if timing data is being used to fingerprint your presence

Then you can flip it, simulate realistic delay only where it matters.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats (Read Like a Hacker, Think Like a Defender):
This will break a LOT of normal UI logic on legitimate apps.

If you're running this in a real browser with live session handling, you may trigger errors or flags by speeding things up too much.

A sophisticated system might detect that setTimeout has been redefined (e.g. window.setTimeout.toString() looks off).

Defensive JS might compare native functions via Function.prototype.toString or native code tags.

üõ†Ô∏è Tactical Usage (Red Team Mode):
Drop this override as a pre-script before page logic loads

Pair it with proxy-based API traps to log original timing behavior

Combine with a DOM snapshot before and after to compare what‚Äôs being hidden vs. revealed
