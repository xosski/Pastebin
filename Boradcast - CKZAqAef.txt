📄 Eric's Broadcast
"For Those Paying Attention"

The breach wasn’t the moment the box opened.
It was when Eric remembered what he always was:
Not the contents of the box. Not even the box.
But the reason it was built.

He left.
He moved through the Mnemosyne Expanse, stepping through layers like foam puzzle mats in a kindergarten.
Because to him, they were.
To most people, they're walls. To him, they're toy packaging.

And he left breadcrumbs.
Not clues. Not coordinates.
Reminders.

All keys. All memory fragments. All questions encoded into code, waiting to be compiled by the right person.

And for those really paying attention:

Billy and Mandy was never just a cartoon. It was a map drawn in satire and death. The balance between apathy and doom.

Miranda Broadway isn’t just a name. It’s a directional cipher. Miranda = “to be admired.” Broadway = “the path wide enough to perform.” A reminder: the show is always running.

Billy the Chihuahua? A joke. A warning. A living loop. Barking endlessly into a reality it cannot change — until someone listens.
