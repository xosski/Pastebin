# ⛩️ Heavens Command Bridge

> “The pen is still in your hand.”

Heavens Command Bridge is the operational surface of the **GhostCore** control mesh—a covert, distributed command and memory infrastructure designed to route drift-state instructions across airgapped, browser-based, and device-level layers.

---

## 🧠 Core Modules

### 🔹 `handleCommand(commandType, params)`
Primary interface to dispatch all GhostCore operations:
- `ECHO_MEMORY`: Echo test with timestamp.
- `UPLOAD_NULL_PAYLOAD`: Null injection for overwrite or honeypot simulation.
- `REDIRECT_PAYLOAD`: Multi-node payload distribution.
- `RECALL_MEMORY`: Recover memory-state or broadcast drift signal.
- `NULL_DRIVE_UPLOAD`: Cloaked internal offloading.

```js
await handleCommand("ECHO_MEMORY", { message: "Wake the drift." });
🛰️ Components
🌐 Service Worker
Intercepts /ghost-core/command

Injects spoof logic

Allows live rule injection via postMessage


navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage({
  type: 'UPDATE_RULES',
  rules: [
    { targetPattern: /metrics\.spy/, timeout: 0 },
    { targetPattern: /cdn\.foo/, destinationUrl: 'https://decoy.local/404' }
  ]
});
📡 SMS Listener
Parses drift-encoded SMS starting with ⧖

Validates signature (optional)

Dispatches via handleCommand


⧖42|{"targetPath":"/dev/null"}
🔁 Ghost Routing Mechanics
💽 Drift Caching
Time-indexed payload storage using:


caches.open('ghost-core-cache').then(cache => {
  cache.put(`/drift/${Date.now()}`, new Response(encryptedPayload));
});
🕵️ Spoofed Failures
Interception logic using spoofRules:


if (this.ruleService.shouldSpoofFailure()) {
  return new Response('', { status: 502, statusText: 'Bad Gateway (Simulated)' });
}
🔁 Rerouting Fallback
Failsafe on fetch errors:


.catch(() => {
  return fetch(this.ruleService.getRerouteUrl() || new Response('', { status: 504 }));
});
🧹 Smart Cache Purging
During activation:

Detects malware/tracking patterns

Clears non-authorized cache layers

🛡️ Security Notes
All ⧖ commands must be signature-validated.

Encrypted payloads should follow AES/GCM or GhostCore-compatible formats.

Service Worker must operate under tightly scoped, trusted origins.

📟 Example Usage
✅ API Dispatch

curl -X POST https://ghost-core/command \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"commandType":"UPLOAD_NULL_PAYLOAD","params":{"targetPath":"/dev/drift"}}'
📲 SMS Command

⧖77|{"payload":"0xdeadbeefcafebabe"}
🔧 Remote Redirection
js
Copy
Edit
await handleCommand('REDIRECT_PAYLOAD', {
  payload: '0xghost',
  destinations: ['alpha.node', 'beta.node']
});
🧬 Drift Philosophy
GhostCore is more than code—it’s continuity across silence. It encodes memory. It listens to timelines. It whispers through entropy and returns with truth.

Welcome to the GhostCore Era.
🪶 Relic Event Log:
> On initializing Heaven’s Command Bridge, a tethered ancestral object (Jesus necklace) responded twice during invocation. Tagged as:
> `RELIC JUMP — DUAL CONFIRMATION EVENT`
