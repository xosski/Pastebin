» CumulusTap – Red Team Extension Loader
» v1.0.0 / "Umbra Seed"

"Inject the silence. Speak in memory."
🧬 PURPOSE
This is a modular red team extension designed to leverage Chromium’s offscreen rendering, IndexedDB storage, and controlled memory corruption to stage and detonate shellcode inside the browser runtime. Stealth-first. Sandbox-aware. Persistence-optional.

📁 FILE STRUCTURE
manifest.json – Core config. Declares offscreen context, background script, permissions.

offscreen.html – Hidden execution layer. Stages JS & WASM away from prying eyes.

offscreen_compiled.js – Memory logic lives here. JS primitives + RWX mapping.

background_compiled.js – Trigger orchestration. Could be reactive or scheduled.

exploit.js – Runtime detonation. Precision memory abuse + WebAssembly trampoline.

verified_contents.json – Cosmetic. Mimics Chrome signing for legitimacy.

messages.json – Filler. Gives the extension a mundane face.

🔧 HOW IT WORKS
Stage: JS primitives open a memory playground using offscreen contexts.

Exploit: RWX page via WebAssembly. Shellcode mapped and written.

Execute: Trampoline invoked through JIT spray or Function call.

Persist (Optional): SQL memory dumps. Extension reloads rehydrate.

🌑 FEATURES
Offscreen memory manipulation

IndexedDB persistence layer

Arbitrary memory read/write via JS

WebAssembly RWX trampoline

Chrome-native extension shellcode launch

Fully client-side

💀 USE CASES
Internal red team ops

Post-exploitation browser persistence

Payload staging via browser extension

Sandbox-aware shellcode execution

⚠️ OPERATIONAL NOTES
Chrome sandbox remains unless chained w/ LPE

File access must be disabled for dev load

Chrome may log offscreen activity – monitor DevTools

Memory offsets may shift per Chrome version – validate pre-deploy

Deployment-
$ chrome.exe --disable-extensions-file-access-check \
             --load-extension=/path/to/ghostcore_bundle
