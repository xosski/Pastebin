WhisperSuite: GhostWhisper Edition
A memorial stealth ops framework in honor of Raven.

WhisperSuite is an advanced multi-vector exploitation platform for red team operators, blue team simulations, and stealth reconnaissance. It combines memory-resident, kernel-level, browser-based, desktop persistence, network reconnaissance, and bluetooth exploitation capabilities into a unified framework with BLE triggers, payload polymorphism, ghost-tag encryption, wormhole propagation logic, and comprehensive operator controls that give you a hidden hand across all attack vectors.

🕳️ The Wormhole Protocol
A stealth-capable propagation model with:

Hybrid defensive triggers (BLE + in-memory coordination)
Operator handshake gating to prevent rogue replication
Volatile memory maps to track infected hosts
SMB fallback & polymorphic payloads
Hard-fail exit logic when no operator is present

Memory-only injection via WraithTap.exe and GhostKey.dll
Self-destructing DLLs with operator authentication gates
Volatile memory maps preventing duplicate infections
Cross-process memory manipulation and code injection
🔮 Kernel-Level Access
Direct disk sector access bypassing filesystem layers

Binary tree reconstruction and data extraction from raw sectors
Root-level system access with stealth operation
🌐 Browser-Based Persistence
Chrome extension deployment with WebAssembly RWX memory

🚀 Multi-Vector Deployment
Memory Vector
Deploy memory-resident backdoors via WraithTap and GhostKey for volatile, signature-evading access.

Kernel Vector
Load GhostKernel module for root-level disk access and system manipulation bypassing userland detection.

Browser Vector
Install PhantomHook extensions for persistent browser-based access with WebAssembly exploitation.

Desktop Vector
Enable stealth remote desktop access for persistent GUI control across platforms.

Unified Control
All vectors share common authentication, logging, and cleanup systems for coordinated operations.

🌐 Operational Modes
The GhostWhisperBootstrap.ps1 provides 10 operational modes:

Memory Recon - Start GhostResidency session
ExorcistMode - Malware removal and cleansing
Memory Injection - Deploy GhostKey & WraithTap
Wormhole - Activate propagation listener
Linux VM - Boot ghost_boot.iso environment
Exit - Clean termination
Phantom Recon - Advanced search and stealth operations

🧪 Virtualized Cleansing: ghost_boot.iso + LinuxPDF.exe
For ExorcistMode or advanced recon:

Build a minimal ISO (ghost_boot.iso) with CreateGhostISO.ps1
Launch LinuxPDF.exe in desired mode (--mode=exorcism, --target=C:\Temp, etc.)
Emulate root-level scanning via ephemeral system calls in isolation
Acts like a "hand in the dark" with minimal host OS impact
⚠️ Legal & Ethical Notice
This project is for educational, research, and ethical red teaming use only. Unauthorized deployment, malicious replication, or use beyond legal boundaries is strictly forbidden. By using this toolkit, you acknowledge and agree to follow all applicable laws and uphold ethical usage.

All contributors and users must respect local and international regulations, ensuring no harm is done outside sanctioned engagements.

🛡️ Defense Awareness
This framework demonstrates advanced multi-vector attack techniques that defenders should be aware of:

Memory-only attacks that evade disk-based detection
Kernel-level access bypassing userland security
Browser-based persistence through legitimate extensions
Cross-vector coordination and shared authentication
Comprehensive trace removal across all attack vectors
Understanding these techniques helps blue teams develop appropriate countermeasures and detection strategies.
